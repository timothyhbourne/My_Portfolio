          p.about-me Hi there! My name is Timothy Harrington Bourne, or you can call me Tim for short. 
          br
          p.about-me I'm currently taking the Full Stack Javascript Tech Degree at Treehouse. I'm aiming to become a self-taught full-stack developer by the end of this year. When I was a kid, I never thought of becoming a developer, but here I am 25 years later, addicted to writing code and wanting to make web applications for those who need it. 
          br
          p.about-me-1 Anyways, have a look around, test out some of the projects I've done, and feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries - or even if you just want to have a nice ol' chat 😊
